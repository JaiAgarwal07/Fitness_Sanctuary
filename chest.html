        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>The Dumbbell Bench Press is a versatile upper body exercise that targets the chest, shoulders, and triceps. By using dumbbells instead of a barbell, it allows for greater range of motion and engages stabilizing muscles for improved balance and strength.</p>
        
        <h2>Key Benefits:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Stabilization:</strong> Unlike the barbell bench press, the Dumbbell Bench Press requires each arm to work independently, promoting balanced muscle development and enhancing stabilizer muscle strength.</li>
            <li><strong>Range of Motion:</strong> Using dumbbells allows for a greater range of motion compared to a barbell, which can lead to increased muscle activation and development in the chest and shoulders.</li>
            <li><strong>Joint Health:</strong> The freedom of movement provided by dumbbells can reduce stress on the shoulder joints, making the exercise more comfortable and suitable for individuals with shoulder issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Dumbbells offer endless variations of the bench press, including incline and decline angles, allowing you to target different areas of the chest and shoulders for a well-rounded upper body workout.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>How to Perform:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Setup:</strong> Lie flat on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand, positioned directly above your chest. Your feet should be planted firmly on the ground.</li>
            <li><strong>Grip and Alignment:</strong> Hold the dumbbells with a neutral grip (palms facing inward), aligning them with the center of your chest.</li>
            <li><strong>Execution:</strong> With control, lower the dumbbells towards your chest while keeping your elbows at a 45-degree angle to your body. Aim to touch the dumbbells lightly to your chest or just below, then press them back up to the starting position, fully extending your arms without locking out your elbows.</li>
            <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Complete the desired number of repetitions with proper form, maintaining a smooth and controlled movement throughout.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Safety Tips:</h2>
