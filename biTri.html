      <p><strong>Muscles Targeted:</strong> Primary emphasis on the biceps brachii (biceps muscles), with secondary involvement of the brachialis and brachioradialis muscles.</p>
      <p><strong>Equipment Needed:</strong> Dumbbells or barbell.</p>
  
      <h2>Description:</h2>
      <p>
        The Bayesian curl is a variation of the traditional biceps curl that involves a unique range of motion, emphasizing both the concentric and eccentric phases of the exercise. It's an effective movement for targeting the biceps muscles while also improving muscle endurance and control.
      </p>
  
      <h2>Steps:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Starting Position:</strong> Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell or barbell in each hand with your arms fully extended downward and palms facing forward.</li>
        <li><strong>Curl the Weights:</strong> Exhale and curl the weights upward toward your shoulders, keeping your elbows close to your sides and minimizing momentum. Contract your biceps at the top of the movement.</li>
        <li><strong>Rotate the Palms:</strong> At the top of the curl, rotate your palms inward (supinate) to fully engage the biceps muscles.</li>
        <li><strong>Lower the Weights:</strong> Inhale and slowly lower the weights back to the starting position, resisting gravity and maintaining control throughout the eccentric (lowering) phase of the movement.</li>
        <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Aim for 3 sets of 10-15 repetitions, focusing on quality over quantity and maintaining proper form throughout each repetition.</li>
      </ol>
  
      <h2>Tips:</h2>
